# Hello World!

### Welcome to The Project. 

An app that we can all build together.

Some cool uses I've already found/configured for the application:

- Set your status and share the public URL to send a hyperlink with a custom message.
- Check the "Session Data" in your dashboard to see what your device looks like to web applications.

If theres something you really want to see on your profile, [let me know](mailto:hello@cursebreakers.net) and I will see what I can do!

If you haven't signed up yet, you may do so [here](/).

In the meantime, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to vist our app and read the docs. I hope that you enjoy The Project!

Sincerely,

[-Esau](/Esau)
